# Early Termination Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added CONFIG.py parameters to control early termination of PSO optimization in the Environment based on tolerance thresholds.

## Changes Made

### 1. CONFIG.py Parameters Added
```python
# --- Early Termination Config ---
ENABLE_EARLY_TERMINATION = True  # Whether to terminate early if convergence tolerance is reached
EARLY_TERMINATION_TOLERANCE = 1e-8  # Tolerance for early termination (same as convergence_threshold_gbest)
EARLY_TERMINATION_MIN_STEPS = 1000  # Minimum steps before early termination can be enabled
EARLY_TERMINATION_MAX_STEPS_RATIO = 0.8  # Ratio of max_steps before early termination can be enabled
```

### 2. Environment Class Updates (SAPSO_AGENT/SAPSO/Environment/Environment.py)

#### Constructor Parameters Added:
- `enable_early_termination=True`: Controls whether early termination is enabled
- `early_termination_tolerance=1e-8`: Sets the tolerance threshold for early termination
- `early_termination_min_steps=1000`: Minimum steps before early termination can be enabled
- `early_termination_max_steps_ratio=0.8`: Ratio of max_steps before early termination can be enabled

#### Step Method Logic Added:
```python
# Store previous gbest for early termination check
previous_gbest = self.last_gbest
self.last_gbest = current_gbest

# Check for early termination based on tolerance (only after minimum steps or max steps ratio reached)
if (self.enable_early_termination and np.isfinite(current_gbest) and 
    self.current_step > 1 and 
    (self.current_step >= self.early_termination_min_steps or 
     self.current_step >= self.max_steps * self.early_termination_max_steps_ratio)):
    # Check if the improvement is below the tolerance threshold
    improvement = abs(previous_gbest - current_gbest)
    if improvement < self.early_termination_tolerance:
        terminated = True
        log_info(f"Early termination at step {self.current_step} due to tolerance threshold. "
                f"Improvement: {improvement:.2e} < {self.early_termination_tolerance:.2e}", module_name)
        break
```

### 3. Training Script Updates (SAPSO_AGENT/Benchmark/train.py)

#### Function Signature Updated:
- Added `enable_early_termination=ENABLE_EARLY_TERMINATION`
- Added `early_termination_tolerance=EARLY_TERMINATION_TOLERANCE`

#### Environment Creation Updated:
- Both temporary and training environments now pass the early termination parameters
- Added logging to show early termination configuration

### 4. Testing Script Updates (SAPSO_AGENT/Benchmark/test.py)

#### Function Signature Updated:
- Added `enable_early_termination=ENABLE_EARLY_TERMINATION`
- Added `early_termination_tolerance=EARLY_TERMINATION_TOLERANCE`

#### Environment Creation Updated:
- Both temporary and evaluation environments now pass the early termination parameters
- Added logging to show early termination configuration

## How It Works

1. **Configuration**: Users can control early termination via CONFIG.py parameters
2. **Tolerance Check**: After each PSO step, the improvement in gbest is calculated
3. **Early Termination**: If improvement < tolerance and early termination is enabled, the episode terminates
4. **Logging**: Clear logging shows when early termination occurs and why

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: Avoids unnecessary computation when optimization has converged
2. **Configurable**: Can be enabled/disabled and tolerance adjusted via CONFIG.py
3. **Compatible**: Works alongside existing convergence checks
4. **Transparent**: Clear logging shows termination reasons

## Usage

### Enable Early Termination:
```python
# In CONFIG.py
ENABLE_EARLY_TERMINATION = True
EARLY_TERMINATION_TOLERANCE = 1e-8
```

### Disable Early Termination:
```python
# In CONFIG.py
ENABLE_EARLY_TERMINATION = False
```

### Adjust Tolerance:
```python
# In CONFIG.py
EARLY_TERMINATION_TOLERANCE = 1e-6  # More strict
EARLY_TERMINATION_TOLERANCE = 1e-10  # Less strict
```

## Testing

The implementation was tested with:
- Early termination enabled with various tolerances
- Early termination disabled
- Verification that termination occurs when improvement < tolerance
- Verification that no termination occurs when disabled
- **Bug fix verification**: Confirmed that early termination doesn't trigger at step 1
- **Timing verification**: Confirmed that early termination only triggers after minimum steps or max steps ratio

All tests passed successfully.

## Bug Fix

**Issue**: Early termination was triggering at step 1 because `self.last_gbest` and `current_gbest` were the same value.

**Solution**: 
1. Store `previous_gbest` before updating `self.last_gbest`
2. Only check for early termination after step 1 (`self.current_step > 1`)
3. Use `previous_gbest` instead of `self.last_gbest` in improvement calculation

### **Timing Enhancement**
**Issue**: Early termination could trigger too early, not giving PSO enough time to explore.

**Solution**:
1. Added `early_termination_min_steps` parameter (default: 1000)
2. Added `early_termination_max_steps_ratio` parameter (default: 0.8)
3. Early termination only enabled after: `current_step >= min_steps` OR `current_step >= max_steps * ratio`
